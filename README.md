# CO2calc

CO2calc
The CO2 calculator is a project for the Aalto University course ELEC-E8004 - Project work. We made a personal carbon footprint calculation model for a Finnish citizen. The course homepage contains older projects and eventually this one too.

Google Apps Script was chosen to be the backend of the calculator and most coding was done in HTML and JavaScript. The model can be used from a separate GUI, which will be placed on the project page for users to interact with.
