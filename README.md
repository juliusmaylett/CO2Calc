# CO2calc

The CO2 calculator is a project for the Aalto University course ELEC-E8004 - Project work. We made a personal carbon footprint calculation model for a Finnish citizen.
The [course homepage](https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/AEEproject/Home) contains older projects and eventually this one too.
